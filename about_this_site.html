        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <p>This website was created by aspiring developer Beth Knights using personal photos and research on the practice of forest bathing. It is intended as a beginner's guide, with a resources library for users who want to find out more.</p>
        <p>The project was first brainstormed as an offshoot of the website <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/challenge_submissions/files/000/590/432/original/_Project_.html?1637708166">mindfulness</a>, which was a project for Code First Girls.</p>

        <h2>Design & Development</h2>
        <p>The color scheme was designed using color wheel theory to echo calming themes found in nature. All photos and video were produced by the author in locations including the Lake District, Portadown, and Belfast.</p>
        <p>The site was coded using Visual Studio Code and tested on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. Please note, it has not yet been adapted for mobile use.</p>
