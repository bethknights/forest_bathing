        <h2>About this Website</h2>
            <br>
               <br>
        <p>This website was created using personal photos and research on the practice of forest bathing.</p>
        <p>It is intended as a beginner's guide to the practice, with a resources library in case users want to find out more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The website was created by aspiring developer Beth Knights as part of the DkIT module 'introtoweb'.</p>
        <p>Beth is a student at Dundalk Institute of Technology with a keen interest in mental health and wellbeing.</p>
        <br>
            </a>
        <br>
        <p>The project was first brainstormed as an offshoot of the website <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/challenge_submissions/files/000/590/432/original/_Project_.html?1637708166">mindfulness</a> which was itself a project for Code First Girls.</p>
        <p>The Forest Bathing colour scheme was conceptualised using colour wheel theory, selecting green shades next to each other on the colour wheel,</p> 
        <p>and also with the intention of echoing calming colour themes which can be found in the natural environment.</p>
        <p>Brighter colours (energetic pink, bright yellow) were added as accent colours.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Website photos were taken by the author in various locations including Arnside Lake District, Portadown Armagh and Belfast Antrim.</p>
        <p>Photos were edited using windows photo editor but remain true to original spirit of the image-set, and have been provided with alt descriptions.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The website was coded using visual studio code, with reference to w3schools and notes provided to me as a student of DkIT.</p>
        <p>This website has been tested using both microsoft edge and google chrome browsers, but has not yet been especially adapted for mobile use.</p>
