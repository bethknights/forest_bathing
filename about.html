          <section class="content-section">
        <p>Although only a beginners guide to the practice, we hope to supply a little information</p>
        <p>to set you off on your forest bathing journey.

        <br>
        <h2>What is forest bathing/shinrin-yoku?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A forest walk is a mindful walk in a forest environment remote from the stresses of the urban everyday world</p>
        <p>Forest bathing itself is a japanese practice (Shinrin-Yoku), which involves reconnecting to nature by immersing</p>
        <p>oneself in the forest, for example through a short walk.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Forest bathing is a practice with ancient roots, with Ancient Greek botanist Pliny the elder first noting the</p>
        <p>health benefits of walking through a Pine forest - Pine is thought to be especially beneficial due to its fragrance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The practice of shinrin-yoku was formalised in the 1980's by Tomohide Akiyama.</p>
        <p>The simplicity of forest bathing is the key to its success - at its heart the practice involves mindfulness and</p>
        <p>immersion in nature. When on a forest walk it is a good practice to take time to meditate on the sounds </p>
        <p>textures, sights and smells of the forest</p>
        <br>
