        <h2>about forest bathing</h2>
        <p>this section contains information about forest bathing.
        <p>although only a beginners guide to the practice, we hope to supply a little information</p>
        <p>to set you off on your forest bathing journey
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>a forest walk is a mindful walk in a forest environment remote from the stresses of the urban everyday world</p>
        <p>forest bathing is a japanese practice (shinrin-yoku) which involves reconnecting to nature by immersing 
        oneself in the forest environment.</p>
        <p>forest bathing is a practice with ancient roots, with pliny the elder first noting the health benefits of walking through a pine forest</p>
        <br>
        <p>the practice of shinrin-yoku was formalised in the 1980's by tomohide akiyama</p>
        <p>the simplicity of forest bathing is the key to its success - at its heart the practice involves mindfulness and immersion in nature</p>
        <p>when on a forest walk it is important to take time to meditate on the sounds, textures, sights and smells of the forest</p>
        <br>
        <p>health benefits: physical health benefits include lowering blood pressure and strengthening the immune system</p>
        <p>mental health benefits include mood and stress reduction benefits as well as associated benefits such as meeting 
          with others and socialising</p>
        <p>additional benefits might include an increased respect for the harmony and beauty of nature, as well as a feeling 
          of empowerment and energisation</p>
